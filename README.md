# ColorMyPhoto
## Description
You upload a photo, and the website converts it into a coloring page. You can color in the coloring page on the website with these tools:
* paint brush tool
* paint bucket tool
* line tool

After that you can download the colored image to print out or save.

## What's next for ColorMyPhoto
I want to add an undo feature, add a custom color picker, and a better UI.
